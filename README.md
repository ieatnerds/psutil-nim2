# psutil-nim2

## Sorry for no recent progress. I've started a new job and don't have a ton of time to work on this right now.
A new implementation of psutil in nim

### Firstly, a huge thank you to John Scillieri for his work on the original 
### psutil-nim and for vital help in starting my implementation. 

## This is very much a WIP, do not try and use!

### If you'd like to contribute, please look at our contrib.md
